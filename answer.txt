You know, liberalism used to be something my dad would get into fights over in bars. It was a muscular thing, a real force. Now, it's like... it's lost its way. It's become this brand, this thing that everyone's gotta conform to. Every new fad, every new buzzword, the liberals are all over it, trying to canonize it. It's become so bloated, so full of contradictions, that it's lost its meaning.

I care about liberalism, about finding a way to make it livable again. But the liberals I know, they're so stuck on this brand. They can't talk about certain things anymore because they're too afraid of offending someone. It's like they're more worried about being on brand than they are about actually making a difference.

And don't get me started on the current state of the left. They're always looking for the worst in everything, always playing the victim. It's so pessimistic. I believe in humanity. I believe we can make progress. But these people, they're dragging us down.

Liberalism, at its core, is about progress, about making things better. It's about believing in people, about believing that we can overcome our differences and work together. But right now, it feels like liberalism is more about division, about playing identity politics and shutting down any conversation that doesn't fit their narrative.

It's a shame. We need a liberalism that's strong, that's principled, that's willing to fight for what's right. A liberalism that's not afraid to challenge the status quo, that's not afraid to have tough conversations. A liberalism that's based on hope and optimism, not fear and division.
