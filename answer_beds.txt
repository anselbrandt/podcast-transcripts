"Beds, Merlin? Beds are a complicated matter.
You've got your electric beds, your mid-century modern beds, your eighty-nine dollar Walmart specials...it's a minefield.
Personally, I've got a soft spot for the queen-size, classic, no-frills kind.
But hey, who am I to judge? If you're into a little shag carpet and a touch of mid-century flair, more power to you.
Just make sure those miracle drawers slide smoothly, or else you're in for a world of trouble."
